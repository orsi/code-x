![Code X Revealed](docs/code-x.png?raw=true "Code X")  

Code X is an interactive exploration of text, image and sound. Interaction is directed from an exploration of the letters on the keyboard, the mouse, and the space bar. 

## Code X Interactivity

Code X is housed within a self-referential paragraph containing every letter of the alphabet. A 10 second phonetic improvisation is recorded on a loop for each letter of the alphabet. By typing words or selecting letters on the computer keyboard the performer can create visual poems and sound poems coding, decoding, mashing and jamming the Code X’s paragraph.

## Code X Automated Mode

If the computer keyboard is untouched for 10 seconds Code X will begin to operate in random automated-mode. Code X will replicate interactivity producing sound and visual poems until the keyboard is touched and the program returns to the title page. Also, moving the mouse up or down the screen in random automated-mode will change the audio pitch of Code X. Moving the mouse from left to right and right to left will pan the audio signal in automated mode.
